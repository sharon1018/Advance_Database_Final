This is a data scientist, “part mathematician, part computer scientist, and part trend spotter” (SAS Institute, Inc.). According to Glassdoor, being a data scientist is the best job in America; with a median base salary of $110,000 and thousands of job openings at a time. The skills necessary to be a good data scientist include being able to retrieve and work with data, and to do that you need to be well versed in SQL, the standard language for communicating with database systems.\n\nThis course is designed to give you a primer in the fundamentals of SQL and working with data so that you can begin analyzing it for data science purposes. You will begin to ask the right questions and come up with good answers to deliver valuable insights for your organization. This course starts with the basics and assumes you do not have any knowledge or skills in SQL. It will build on that foundation and gradually have you write both simple and complex queries to help you select data from tables.  You'll start to work with different types of data like strings and numbers and discuss methods to filter and pare down your results. \n\nYou will create new tables and be able to move data into them. You will learn common operators and how to combine the data. You will use case statements and concepts like data governance and profiling. You will discuss topics on data, and practice using real-world programming assignments. You will interpret the structure, meaning, and relationships in source data and use SQL as a professional to shape your data for targeted analysis purposes. \n\nAlthough we do not have any specific prerequisites or software requirements to take this course, you a simple text editor is recommended for the final project.

Professional mathematicians think a certain way to solve real problems, problems that can arise from the everyday world, or from science, or from within mathematics itself.

We present some of the most important theoretical results in the area: notably, Arrow's Theorem, which proves that there is no \"perfect\" voting system, and also the Gibbard-Satterthwaite and Muller-Satterthwaite Theorems.  We move on to consider the problem of making collective decisions when agents are self interested and can strategically misreport their preferences. We explain \"mechanism design\" -- a broad framework for designing interactions between self-interested agents -- and give some key theoretical results. Our third week focuses on the problem of designing mechanisms to maximize aggregate happiness across agents, and presents the powerful family of Vickrey-Clarke-Groves mechanisms.  The course wraps up with a fourth week that considers the problem of allocating scarce resources among self-interested agents, and that provides an introduction to auction theory.\n\nYou can find a full syllabus and description of the course here:  http://web.stanford.edu/~jacksonm/GTOC-II-Syllabus.html \n\nThere is also a predecessor course to this one, for those who want to learn or remind themselves of the basic concepts of game theory: https://www.coursera.org/learn/game-theory-1  \n\nAn intro video can be found here:   http://web.stanford.edu/~jacksonm/Game-Theory-2-Intro.mp4", "target_audience": "Who is this class for: This course is based on advanced undergraduate and masters level material and is aimed at researchers, students, and practitioners who wish to learn more about game theory and mechanism design.

Just 30 years after his death, an algorithm for encryption of secret messages was developed using achievements of number theory.

An important reference rate for many interest rate contracts is the LIBOR (London Interbank Offered Rate). Loans can be borrowed over future time intervals at rates that are agreed upon today. These rates are called forward or futures rates, depending on the type of the agreement.

В курсе мы познакомим слушателей с наиболее важными областями и инструментами современной комбинаторики, причем многие темы курса по сути уникальны: здесь не только классические комбинаторные величины и тождества, но также и общая теория обращения Мебиуса, и диаграммы Юнга, и рекурсия, и производящие функции. Это позволит нам в дальнейших курсах выйти на реальные приложения в анализе таких сложных сетей, как Интернет, социальные, биологические сети, сети межбанковских взаимодействий и др.\n\nДля участия в курсе слушателю необходимо иметь базовые представления о теории множеств и началах анализа. Все остальные понятия будут введены в ходе курса.\n\nКурс состоит из 7 недель лекций и 1 недели экзамена. Каждую неделю слушатель выполняет задания, составляющие 10% от всего курса (5% тест и 5% задачи с ответом).

This leads us to adopt the stance of bioinspiration rather than biomimicry, i.e., extracting principles rather than appearances and applying them systematically to our machines. A little more thinking about typical animal mobility leads us to focus on appendages – limbs and tails – as sources of motion. The second portion of the week offers a bit of background on the physical and mathematical foundations of limbed robotic mobility. We start with a linear spring-mass-damper system and consider the second order ordinary differential equation that describes it as a first order dynamical system. We then treat the simple pendulum – the simplest revolute kinematic limb – in the same manner just to give a taste for the nature of nonlinear dynamics that inevitably arise in robotics. We’ll finish with a treatment of stability and energy basins.\n\n Link to bibliography: https://www.coursera.org/learn/robotics-mobility/resources/pqYOc ", "video": ["0.0.0 What you will learn in this course", "1.0.0 What you will learn this week", "1.1.1 Why and how do animals move?", "1.1.2 Bioinspiration", "1.1.3 Legged Mobility: dynamic motion and the management of energy", "Setting up your MATLAB environment", "MATLAB Tutorial I - Getting Started with MATLAB", "MATLAB Tutorial II - Programming", "1.2.1 Review LTI Mechanical Dynamical Systems", "1.2.2 Introduce Nonlinear Mechanical Dynamical Systems: the dissipative pendulum in gravity", "1.2.2 Nonlinear mechanical systems", "1.2.3 Linearization & Normal Forms", "1.2.3 Linearizations", "1.1.1 Why and how do animals move", "1.1.2 Bioinspiration", "1.1.3 Legged Mobility: dynamic motion and the management of energy"]}, {"title": "Behavioral (Templates) & Physical (Bodies)", "description": "We’ll start with behavioral components that take the form of what we call “templates:” very simple mechanisms whose motions are fundamental to the more complex limbed strategies employed by animal and robot locomotors.

We’ll start with the notion of physical scaling laws and then review useful materials properties and their associated figures of merit.

Sprawled posture runners like cockroaches have six legs which typically move in a stereotyped pattern which we will consider as a model for a hexapedal machine.  Nature’s quadrupeds have their own varied gait patterns which we will match up to various four-legged robot designs as well. Finally, we’ll consider bipedal machines, and we’ll take the opportunity to distinguish human-like robot bipeds that are almost foredoomed to be slow quasi-static machines from a number of less animal-like bipedal robots whose embrace of bioinspired principles allows them to be fast runners and jumpers. \n\nLink to bibliography: https://www.coursera.org/learn/robotics-mobility/resources/pqYOc ", "video": ["3.0.0 What you will learn this week", "3.1.1 Review of kinematics", "3.1.2 Introduction to dynamics and control", "3.2.1 Sprawled posture runners", "3.2.2 Quadrupeds", "3.2.3 Bipeds", "3.1.1 Review of kinematics (MATLAB)", "3.1.2 Introduction to dynamics and control", "3.2.1 Sprawled posture runners", "3.2.2 Quadrupeds", "3.2.3 Bipeds", "Simply stabilized SLIP (MATLAB)"]}, {"title": "Composition (Programming Work)", "description": "We now introduce the concept of dynamical composition, reviewing two types: a composition in time that we term “sequential”;  and composition in space that we call “parallel.” We’ll put a bit more focus into that last concept, parallel composition and review what has been done historically, and what can be guaranteed mathematically when the simple templates of week 2 are tasked to worked together “in parallel” on variously more complicated morphologies.

They are modular in one variable and abelian (or double periodic) in another variable. The theory of Jacobi modular forms became an independent research subject after the famous book of Martin Eichler and Don Zagier “Jacobi modular forms” (Progress in Mathematics, vol. 55, 1985) which was cited more than a thousand times in research papers. This is due to many applications of Jacobi forms in arithmetic, topology, algebraic and differential geometry, mathematical and theoretical physics, in the theory of Lie algebras, etc. The list of mentioned subjects shows that my course might be useful for master and Ph.D. students working in different directions.\nMotivated undergraduate students can also study this subject. To follow the course one has to know only elementary basic facts from the theory of modular forms (for example, the paragraphs 1-4 of the chapter VII of Serre’s “A Course in Arithmetic” are enough).\nThe main hero of the course is the Jacobi theta-series. Using it we will construct a lot of concrete examples of Jacobi forms in one or many abelian variables, in particular, Jacobi forms for root systems.\nFor some of you, who will be successful with the theoretical exercises of the course, I am ready to formulate research problems for Master or Ph.D. thesis.
